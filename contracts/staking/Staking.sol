/**
 * @title  Staking
 * @author Forked from: Synthetix
 *         Changes by: Props
 * @notice Reward stakers of staking tokens with reward tokens, on a pro-rata basis.
 * @dev    In order to allow for passive reward accrual, it uses an ever-increasing
 *         `rewardsPerTokenStored` variable that gets updated on every write action
 *         to the contract.
 *         Changes to the original Synthetix contract:
 *         - the contract is upgradeable
 *         - the contract is ownable and only the controller is able to perform state-changing
 *           actions (this means individual users cannot directly interact with instances
 *           of this contract)
 *         - the rewards get distributed in a perpetual fashion, closely following a
 *           diminishing returns curve (at most once per day, the `rewardRate`
 *           and `periodFinish` variables get updated via the `updateRewardRate` modifier)
 *         - any outstanding rewards (not yet earned by any staker) can be withdrawn by the
 *           designated rewards distribution account
 *         - the `rewardsDuration` variable gets calculated from the `dailyRewardsEmission`
 *           parameter on initialization, which specifies the percentage of the remaining
 *           rewards pool that should get distributed each day
 *         - the staked and withdrawn amounts are implicit (the contract trusts its controller
 *           to provide correct values), no staking tokens are transferred to or from this
 *           contract
 *         - on claiming, rewards are tranferred to the controller of the contract instead of
 *           the actual recipient, the controller being responsible for handling the rewards as
 *           it sees fit
