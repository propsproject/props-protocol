## Governance

Although initially controlled by the Props team, the Props protocol is designed in such a way to allow for a fully decentralized governance process. Based on Compound's governance system, Props governance is powered by the sProps token, which gives holders voting power in protocol governance actions. Props' governance fully resides on L2 but governance proposals can include actions that affect L1 state (eg. state related to the L1 Props token). The L1 state-changing actions are to be relayed through a custom bridge.
